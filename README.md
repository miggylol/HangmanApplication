# HangmanGame

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to show how I started off in Python. The code looks bad as there is no organization. It is just a jumbled mess. There is little to no styling effort so reading it is a pain. it was completed on 10/24/17 during my freshman year.

## The Updated Version
The file "Better_HangmanGame" is also part of this repo to show my progress as a programmer. This program is seperated into functions without the use of any global variables. This can be run on any IDE.

## Test
This is to test out the branching in Git Deskstop
